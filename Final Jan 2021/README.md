From the given task in the exam I have done the following:
1) Create a simple Product model: This is completed.
2) Create a simple buy page: For this I have added the controller in controller added the code to list the products but, the UI is not working not sure why.
3)  Attempt to fix this using both pessimistic and optimistic locking: I have implemented optimistic locking and for passimistic locking I have created the read and write lock but since the product is not updated I ws not able to put the locks before update.
4)  Create a simple unit test: This part is not completed
